_**gitSum(education)**_ was an idea that was created within our group with the purpose of helping anyone who is looking to further their own education in coding and other computer technologies. _**gitSum(education)**_ will provide  an individual the ability to access tutorials that are applicable to the real world to help further their education. It will provide access to a library of technical material that can be accessed from one place. It will allow for a user/individual to learn at their own pace as well. _**gitSum(education)**_ will also serve as platform where users can add their own tutorials and add to the gitSum library for others to learn from.

### We have created a site where you can:
* go to watch tutorials to learn more about MERN
* register a profile to:
  * upload your own tutorials to help our community learn more

#### Technologies used in the creation of this site:
* NodeJS
* Express
* Mysql
* Sequelize
* Handlebars
* SASS
* Webpack
* passport
* bcrypt
* parsleyjs

#### Things we would like to improve on:
1. Add more categories (expand past MERN)
2. Some redesign as the site gets more popular
3. Work on the api to return only the data that is needed
4. Improve footer with links and content
5. Make tutorial cards equal height
6. Make the search a full-text search
